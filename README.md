# 🗣️ KwikSpeak

KwikSpeak is a web-based learning platform designed to help individuals who struggle with expressing their thoughts clearly. It provides structured lessons, practical tips, and communication exercises aimed at improving articulation, confidence, and public speaking skills.

- Articulate their thoughts properly
- Speak with clarity and confidence

- Building a custom user authentication system
- Creating modular, reusable apps inside a Django project
- Using Django views and URL routing to navigate dynamically
- Animating elements using JavaScript and enhancing user experience
- Structuring media uploads and rendering user-generated content
- Styling from scratch with HTML/CSS and basic responsiveness
